# QR Code Scanner and Generator

This Flutter application provides functionality for both scanning and generating QR codes.

## QR Code Scanner

The QR code scanner feature allows users to use their device's camera to scan QR codes. Upon scanning, the application interprets the information encoded within the QR code, which could include text, URLs, or other data. This feature is helpful for quickly accessing information encoded in QR codes, such as website links, contact information, or product details.

## QR Code Generator

With the QR code generator feature, users can create their own QR codes by inputting data such as text, URLs, or contact details. The generator then encodes this information into a QR code format, which can be easily shared, printed, or displayed digitally. This feature provides a convenient way to encode information into QR codes for various purposes, including sharing website links, creating digital business cards, or facilitating contactless transactions.
